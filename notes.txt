## BIP0034
- not really sure why it's necessary to add the block height to coinbase tx
- something to do with MASF

## Block Headers
- Blocks are batches of transactions
- Block headers are metadata about transactions in the block
-- Version                          4  bytes  LE
-- Previous Block ID                32 bytes  LE
-- Merkel Root                      32 bytes  LE
-- Timestamp                        4  bytes  LE
-- bits                             4  bytes  LE
-- Nonce (Number used only once)    4  bytes  LE
                                    ============
                                    80 bytes

- Block height at 07:50 UTC+02:00 05/07/2020, is 637769
- Thus total block header size is 637769 * 80b / 1024^2 ~ 48.65MB
- Block header does not container block ID of itself - block ID is a the hash256 of the block header, interpretted in LE
- ** Not sure why block ID starts with so many zeros - it's simply the output of a hash256, which I expect to look random (not pattern of zeros)
-
