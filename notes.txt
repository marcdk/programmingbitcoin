# Chapter 9

## BIP0034
- not really sure why it's necessary to add the block height to coinbase tx
- something to do with MASF

## Block Headers
- Blocks are batches of transactions
- Block headers are metadata about transactions in the block
-- Version                          4  bytes  LE
-- Previous Block ID                32 bytes  LE
-- Merkel Root                      32 bytes  LE
-- Timestamp                        4  bytes  LE
-- Bits                             4  bytes  LE
-- Nonce (Number used only once)    4  bytes  LE
                                    ============
                                    80 bytes

- Block height at 07:50 UTC+02:00 05/07/2020, is 637769
- Thus total block header size is 637769 * 80b / 1024^2 ~ 48.65MB
- Block header does not container block ID of itself - block ID is the hash256 of the block header, interpreted in LE
? Not sure why block ID starts with so many zeros - it's simply the output of a hash256, which I expect to look random (not pattern of zeros)
 
## Version
- Originally intended for use by a miner to signal readiness for a particular feature
- e.g v2 signalled readiness for BIP0034, v3 for BIP0066, and v4 for BIP0065 - however only a single set of features can be signalled (not an arbitrary choice)
- Solution proposed in BIP0009 to set first 3 bits to 001, and use remaining 29 bits to signal readiness for softforks (or features ?) 
- BIP0009 proposes that a certain percentage of all previous blocks in a given 2016 block epoch signal readiness for a softfork in the maner (usally 95% of blocks, BIP0091 required on 80%)
? So signal bits are 'reset' after the epoch ?

## Previous Block ID
? Ends in a bunch of 00 bytes (see last point in `Block Headers` above)

## Merkle Root
- Fingerprint (hash) of ordered list of transactions
- Used in Simplified Payment Verification (SPV)

## Timestamp
- Unix timestamp (of when block was mined ?)
- Interpreted as unsigned int, and will overflow in the year 2106

## Bits
- Encodes proof of work required in this block (TBD)

## Nonce
- 'Number used only once` - This is what is sought by the miner
